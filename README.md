# lexo-django-guide
A personal guide to creating a Python/Django Site

This Readme file will contain the steps I took towards a fully functional website for a small organisation.

The site needs to contain sections such as News, FAQ, About etc.

## Create a git repository
  1. Create git repository (assuming you have a github account since you're here already)
      - The name and description will appear as the first two lines in this document
  2. Select "Public" unless you like to pay for privacy
  3. Check "Initialize this repository with a README
      - Creates this file
  4. Select Python from the "Add .gitignore".
      - It allows you to ignore files which do not need to be tracked (e.g. temporary files)
  5. Read about formatting this file
      - E.g. [here](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)
  6. Commit changes
