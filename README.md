# lexo-django-guide
A personal guide to creating a Python/Django Site

This Readme file will contain the steps I took towards a fully functional website for a small organisation.

The site needs to contain sections such as News, FAQ, About etc.
I like to use linux, so the instruction will be linux based, at least regarding the setup and programming.

## Create a git repository
1. Create git repository (assuming you have a github account since you're here already)
    - The name and description will appear as the first two lines in this document
2. Select "Public" unless you like to pay for privacy
3. Check "Initialize this repository with a README
    - Creates this file
4. Select Python from the "Add .gitignore".
    - It allows you to ignore files which do not need to be tracked (e.g. temporary files)
5. Read about formatting this file
    - E.g. [here](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)
6. Commit changes
    - I did not create a new branch for this commit as it is the first/initial commit.
    
## Clone the repository to local folder
I think it's better to get the git repository to the local computer before starting the project

1. Figure out if git is installed on yo
    - If not, figure out a way to install it
2. Clone the repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/eliasthor/lexo-django-guide.git
    ```

## How to start the project
Now, how do I start the project it self?

It would also be nice to be able to have the project running in linux, but the coding could take place anywhere.

To make that work, every change would need to be committed and pushed to git, then pulled from git into the testing/running environment how it turns out.

To begin with I'll stick to linux. I will use Ubuntu Bash from within Windows 10 (search for instructions on how to run ubuntu on Windows 10)

1. Look for some how-to instructions
    - As soon as I know what I'm doing, I can update (or even remove) this step
    - I start by looking at [Django Girls Tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/)
    - Django Girls Tutorial assumes python3.6 while my windows 10 version of ubuntu only has 3.5, I'll need to work around that
2. Start by creating a folder for the procect and move into that folder
    ```
    mkdir LexoDjango
    cd LexoDjango
    ```
3. Set up virtual environment within the new folder
    - Virtual environment (virtual env or just venv) seems to be the trend, I guess it "shields" the setup from unwanted changes in the enviromental settings
    ```
    python3 -m venv lexovenv
    ```
    Activate it (I find it easier to use alias for this)
    ```
    alias lexovenvstart=". lexovenv/bin/activate"
    lexovenvstart
    ```
4. Install Django
