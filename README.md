# lexo-django-guide
A personal guide to creating a Python/Django Site

This Readme file will contain the steps I took towards a fully functional website for a small organisation.

The site needs to contain sections such as News, FAQ, About etc.

## Create a git repository
1. Create git repository (assuming you have a github account since you're here already)
    - The name and description will appear as the first two lines in this document
2. Select "Public" unless you like to pay for privacy
3. Check "Initialize this repository with a README
    - Creates this file
4. Select Python from the "Add .gitignore".
    - It allows you to ignore files which do not need to be tracked (e.g. temporary files)
5. Read about formatting this file
    - E.g. [here](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)
6. Commit changes
    - I did not create a new branch for this commit as it is the first/initial commit.
